try_git
=======
This project contains several artifacts:
-link_scraper.html (as referenced on my twitter wall)
-shell.txt which provides details on how to use github in general
-..add more later on

The project was created by following the try_git tutorial on github at some point (as evidenced by the octocat.txt files in it's versioning history a while ago).
